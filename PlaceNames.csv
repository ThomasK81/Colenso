This corresponds with modern Aramoana, and should not be confused with Te Onepoto south of Waimarama. Colenso’s spelling is consistent and is supported by Arrowsmith’s version	6 Dec 43; 12-13 Feb 46; 27-28 Oct 48; 5-6 Mar, 26-27 Nov 50; 29 Apr-1 May 52
Owae		Bagnall & Petersen (p. 38) place this on Helena Bay, Whangaruru Bay, presumably near the mouth of the Owai Stream which flows into the southwest corner of Helena Bay	13-17 Feb 36; 21-24 Jun, 26-30 Sep, 21-23 Dec 39; 7-8 Jan, 14-16 Aug, 20-22 Sep, 8-11 Oct 41; 18-21 Feb 42

Oẁakau		On the Tutaekuri River near the point where the ascent of Kuripapango (Te Kohurau) began, but not located	14 Feb 52
Oẁiorangi		Owiorangi appears on Arrowsmith’s 1850 map as on the west bank of the Waikare River near Warau, Urewera. This indicates a position near Otahuao	12 Jan 44
Paharakeke	(a small wood)	Paharakeke Stream drains into Rangatea Lagoon near the southern end of Lake Wairarapa	6 Nov 45; 18 Mar 46
Paharakeke Wood	near Patea	This locality does not appear in the Journal but in the list of 31 January 1853, and might possibly be a confusion with the Wairarapa wood of the same name. The specimen, 4257 Hymenophyllum, is not represented at WELT so no decision based on phytogeographic considerations can be made	
Pahawa		The Pahaoa River on the Wairarapa coast	18 Mar, 22-24 Nov 45; 25-27 Feb, 8-9 Sep 46; 6-10 May, 16-19 Oct 47; 20-24 Apr, 4-7 Nov 48; 24-26 Apr 49; 16-19 Mar 50; 12-14 Apr 51; 10-14 Apr 52

Pahitaua		Arrowsmith’s 1850 map shows Pahitaua as close to the east bank of the Whakatane. Colenso travelled ENE to Pahitaua before turning southeast to Te Rangaataneiti, which would indicate Pahitaua as being in the vicinity of the hill now known as Rangiahua	10 Jan 44
Paihia	Bay of Islands		Colenso was in residence here from 31 December 1834 until 12 June 1843

Pakaraka		On the main highway between Kawakawa and Ohaeawai. Colenso described it as (Mr Edward Williams’) farm about 13 miles inland from Paihia	15 Apr 39
Pakaraka	4 miles from Pihoi in the Ẁangarei district	In 1841, Pakaraka was reached from Pataua in half a day. From Pakaraka the Bay was crossed to Pohue and recrossed to Tamatarau. This suggests that Pakaraka was at the head of Whangarei Harbour, on the present site of Whangarei	10 Dec 39; 27-28 Sep 41
Pakarau		Pakarau was reached in 2½ hours’ travelling northwest and west from Tapiri Assuming Tapiri and Matamata to be the same or contiguous places, Pakarau would have been in the vicinity of modern Morrinsville

Te Pakiaka	near Station, Ahuriri	Bagnall & Petersen (p. 237) show Pakiaka Bush on the approximate site of Mangateretere south of Whakatu	The name does not appear in the Journal, but first appears in the list of 22 December 1846
Pakoẁai	Te Pakowai village –  near the 2 teeth	Bagnall & Petersen (p. 206) show Pakowhai at Black Head (Parimahu). Colenso, however, in an undated list, described it as near ‘the 2 Teeth’. Arrowsmith’s 1850 map shows the 2 teeth as about halfway between Porangahau and Cape Turnagain. Arrowsmith would appear to have confused the 2 Teeth with Cook’s Tooth	13 Feb, 22 Aug 46; 24-25 May, 5-6 Oct 47; 12-13 Jun, 28 Oct 48
Pakuku		Bagnall & Petersen (p. 217n) suggest that this is the present Papuku Stream, south of Cape Turnagain	10-11 Mar 45; 16 Apr, 24-25 Oct, 29 Nov 45; 17-19 Feb, 26-28 Aug 46; 19-20 May, 9-11 Oct 47; 30-31 Oct 48

Pamateao		Described by Colenso as a desert beach and as a point 20 miles N. of Cape Palliser but the name has not been found on any maps including those of Arrowsmith	7 Apr 52
Panekiri (Panekire)	Panekiri Range on the southern shore of Waikaremoana but not mentioned in the Journal		21-26 Dec 43

Paparaumu (Paparaaumu)	Bagnall & Petersen ( p. 38) show this north of Owae, in the approximate position of modern Mokau on the Whangaruru Harbour	The name does not appear on modern maps	24 Jun, 30 Sep-1 Oct, 23 Dec 39; 6-7 Jan, 16-17 Aug 41
Parae		Appears on a few wrappings Not a locality but a Māori word meaning undulating or level country

Pareranui	Eastern side of Taupo plains	Pareranui Stream is one of the tributary streams of the Waipunga River east of Pohokura on the Taupo-Napier Highway	The locality would have been passed on or about 15 February 1847 and indicates that Colenso’s route lay west of the present highway
Parewarewa	On the west bank of the Whakatane River, 1½ miles downstream from Tahunaroa		20 Jan 44
Parikarangaranga	On the Turanganui River, Wairarapa	Pakarangaranga is a trig point to the north of the river about two miles from the junction of the Pirinoa and Whakatomotomo Roads	3 Apr 45; 29-30 Mar 49

Pataua	Pataua Creek, near Wangarei, E. Coast	At the southern end of Ngunguru Bay	27 Sep 41
Patea	Western base of Ruahine range	The statement in In Memoriam ( p. 72) that two visits were made in 1852, the second in May, is not borne out by the Journal. The events described occurred on the February 1852 visit	23-24 Feb 47; 1-3, 6-7 Jan, 6-13 Dec 48; 22-27 Nov 49; 18-27 Oct 51; 19-24 Feb 52
Pauanui (?Black Head)	Paoanui Point is north of Tuingara and thus considerably north of Black Head or Parimahu	Colenso appears to have mistakenly applied Cook’s name in the earlier instances	7 Dec 43; 6 Mar 45; 13-14 Jun 48
Pepepe		B. Y. Ashwell’s Mission Station on the Waikato River. Colenso took an hour to travel by canoe from Ngaruawahia downstream to Pepepe, and Arrowsmith’s 1850 map shows it on the west bank well below the Waipa junction. Cowan (1922, illustration p.24-25) shows Ashwell’s station, Kaitotehe, opposite Taupiri. Pascoe (Exploration in N.Z. 1971, p.20) also refers to Pepepe Mission Station … Near Taupiri …	30-31 Jan 44
Petane (Petani)	A few miles north of Ahuriri at the northern end of the old lagoon and at the mouth of the Esk River	The name, a rendering of Bethany, is a replacement for Te Kapemaihi. The change could possibly have taken place at Christmas 1848. The Native Teacher, Paul Toki, is named for both place names. Lambert ( p. 312) has another name, Kaiarero, as the old name for Petane, but does not mention Te Kapemaihi. Buchanan ( p. 168) cites yet another name, Oharua	30-31 Jan, 14-15, 18-19 Jun, 12-13 Dec 49; 11-12, 14-15 Jan, 9-10, 15-20 May, 17-18 Jun, 2-3 Oct, 20-21, 23-24 Dec 50; 1-3, 5-10 Mar, 2-4 Jun, 27-29 Sep 51; 13 Nov, 16-17 Dec 51; 10-13, 30-31 Jan, 5-7 Jun, 1-3 Jul, 11-12, 14, 26-27 Aug 52

Pikitanga	Ruahine Forest Pikitanga on R. Makororo	Not a locality name, but a Māori word meaning ascent, as of a mountain, in this case the Ruahines This is an interesting instance of Colenso’s bilingualism

Pohatupapa		This appears to be the same as the present locality of Blackhead, north of the promontory of that name, which identification is supported by Buchanan ( p. 168)	6 Dec 43; 8-9 May 49
Te Pohue	Hawke’s Bay	On Highway 5 from Napier to Taupo, 29 miles from Napier	23 Apr 46; 29-30 Jan 49
